> A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data
  and the web. Started out as a fork of 'RJSONIO', but has been completely
  rewritten in recent versions. The package offers flexible, robust, high
  performance tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful
  for building pipelines and interacting with a web API. The implementation is
  based on the mapping described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to
  converting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to
  stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with the
  package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded consistently for
  use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
